# Prediction-Model_Olympic-Medal
### Objective:
 Analyzed Olympic medal data using athlete event datasets from 1896 to 2016, applying various machine learning models to predict medal outcomes.

### Models Tested:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Neural Network
### Model Evaluation DataFrame: 
A DataFrame (model_ev) was created to store and compare the accuracy of different models.

### Final Model Choice: 
The Random Forest Classifier was chosen based on its superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 89.02%.

### Model Fitting and Prediction: 
The Random Forest model was trained using train_x and train_y. Predictions were made using test_x, and accuracy was calculated using accuracy_score.

### Conclusion: 
The Random Forest Classifier performed the best among all models tested, making it the optimal choice for this analysis.
